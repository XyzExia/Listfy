## Description

Working individually or as a team, we were given the task of building a MERN Stack Single-Page application of our choice. This project gives us the opportunity to demonstrate and implement the skills and knowledge gained from the beginning of our full stack journey. The project had to include the following requirements.

This project: Listfy is a list taking application demonstrating full CRUD functionality inside a MERN stack app. 

See the Deployed Heroku App at
(https://listfyed.herokuapp.com/)


### Project Requirements

* Use React for the front end.

* Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.

* Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.

* Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.

* Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

* Have a polished UI.

* Be responsive.

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Include authentication (JWT).

* Protect sensitive API key information on the server.

* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, high-quality comments, etc.).
